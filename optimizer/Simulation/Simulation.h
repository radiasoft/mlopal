// Class Simulation
//   Abstract class every simulation has to implement to be able to
//   work with the optimization pilot.
//
//   To be supported the simulation code has to be called as a library taking
//   as an argument an MPI communicator specifying on which processors the
//   simulation runs.
//
//   TODO:
//     - formulate the 'simulation' part as a pipeline.. workers can simply put
//       together their own pipelines situation-dependent.
